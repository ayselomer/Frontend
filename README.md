  It took me two tries to get this landing page the way I wanted it to be. I struggled a little with using flexbox to align all my divs and images. It took trial and error to make it look how I wanted it to look like. 

**Things I learnt:**
    - FlexBox
    - Span 
    - Box layout in css
    - how to write better code

**Next Steps:**
    - Integrating JavaScript
